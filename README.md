# CRM-API
An api used to perform CRUD, authorization, and authentication functionalities on Developer, Project, Team, and other records (models)
The Api currently works with a local SQL Server, which I manage using the MSSM app. 
The Api uses azure blob services to store and manage images.
The Api uses Sendgrid APi for sending Emails
The Api uses Serilog for logging events and activies.
